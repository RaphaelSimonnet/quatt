We believe that quality and collaboration are key in our development process, and in this assignment, we&#39;re looking for candidates who understand that. ### Assignment Create e2e test scenarios for the CRUD user operations with API Version 2 and HTTP Bearer Token authentication from https://gorest.co.in/ service. Use JavaScript or TypeScript and a framework of your choice (currently we use Jest and Supertest, please don&#39;t use Postman for this). ### What we want to see is: -  How you test APIs -  Good structuring of tests for reusability and maintainability -  Provide clear instructions on how to run the tests in README -  GitHub CI/CD is a plus Once you have completed the assignment, kindly provide us with a link to your publicly accessible GitHub repository. If you come across any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please don&#39;t hesitate to report them. Good luck with your assignment, and if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of it, don&#39;t hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to seeing your work!",
