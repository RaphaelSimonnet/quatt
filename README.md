### Introduction
Hey there, and welcome to our Quality Assurance (QA) assignment! We&#39;re
thrilled to have you on board and eager to see how you tackle this
challenge. We believe that quality and collaboration are key in our
development process, and in this assignment, we&#39;re looking for candidates
who understand that.

### Assignment
Create e2e test scenarios for the CRUD user operations with API Version 2
and HTTP Bearer Token authentication from https://gorest.co.in/ service.
Use JavaScript or TypeScript and a framework of your choice (currently we
use Jest and Supertest, please don&#39;t use Postman for this).

### What we want to see is:
* How you test APIs  
* Good structuring of tests for reusability and maintainability   
* Provide clear instructions on how to run the tests in README   
* GitHub CI/CD is a plus

Once you have completed the assignment, kindly provide us with a link to
your publicly accessible GitHub repository. If you come across any bugs or
have suggestions for improvements, please don&#39;t hesitate to report them.
Good luck with your assignment, and if you have any questions or need
clarification on any aspect of it, don&#39;t hesitate to reach out.
Looking forward to seeing your work!
